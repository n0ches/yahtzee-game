The objective of Yahtzee is to get as many points as possible by rolling three dices.

Two people play this game. Each player has a queue. 

The game consists of 15 turns. In each turn, a player throws three dices. The numbers must be inserted into his/her queue. After that, the player can gain a point if one of the following combinations exists in his/her queue:
 
    Yahtzee -> You must have at least 4 of the same number.         Score: 20
    Large straight -> You must have at least 6 consecutive numbers  Score: 10 
    
If a combination occurs, the player gets the related point and these numbers must be deleted from the queue.  

In one turn, a player can get points for multiple combinations.

The program displays all steps until the game is over. 

At the end of the game, the winner is displayed, if exists.
